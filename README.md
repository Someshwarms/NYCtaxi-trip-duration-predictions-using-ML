# NYCtaxi-trip-duration-predictions-using-ML


Link for the dataset used in this project:https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data?select=train.zip


Conclusion: As in this model development of NYC trip duration in terms of MSE,MAE and RMSE RandomForest and LGBM this 2 algorithm performed way better then other algorithm while LGBM performed little better in comparision of RandomForest.
